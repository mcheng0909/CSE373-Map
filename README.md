# CSE 373 Final
## Part 1: Graph Algorithm Design
This is a pretty challenging programming assignment focused primarily on Graph Algorithm Design, so be sure to allocate an appropriate amount of time to this. Make sure to get your code pushed on-time Thursday night!

### Installation
You can obtain the final project code similarly to how you obtained code elsewhere in this class - through using the clone through SSH button on GitLab.

## Part 2: Iterative Design - Given Redesign

See instructions for the Part 2: Iterative Design Writeup on canvas. 

Your redesign is given below, but you don't need to turn in anything related to the iterative design final on Gitlab, you only need to turn in your writeup document on Canvas!

### Adding Social Features to Husky Maps
Enhance Husky Maps with social features to personalize and recommend locations.
1. Data Structure Representation:
Describe the data structures and graph representations used to store users, their friends, and locations.
2. Functionalities:
    - **Save a Location:** Allow users to save a location.
    - **Invite a Random Mutual Friend:** Invite a random mutual friend (who is friends with at least two of your friends) to a location. The location must be saved by the mutual friend but not by you. Note that mutual friends are not initially your friends but can become friends in the future.
    - **Recommend Locations:** Recommend locations based on other users who have saved some of your places, as you might like locations they have saved that you haven't.


## Authors and acknowledgment
It took a lot of work to bring this to life from concepts from prior quarters. Hopefully this final brings value to you and helps you encapsulate the knowledge you have gained throughout CSE 373.
